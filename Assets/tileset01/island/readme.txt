"Retro tileset" series is suitale for low resolution retro style action games.(side scroller type)

In this volume 01,there are various tilesets for constructing " island " stage.

Reference character size is 32x32 or 16x32 pixels (width x height).



"samples.png" and "samples2.png" are sample image of combination.(but not spritesheet)




<caution> 

1. about pixels per unit(PPU)


In this asset , default pixels per unit(PPU) of each spritesheet is 15.9 .

If you have pixel perfect script (for camera and for each object) ,you had better change PPU from 15.9 to 16 before you begin constructing each level.



2.about true color

Parency bug occurs in current version of unity when you use png image in [16bit] setting,so use png image in [true color] setting. 
(default setting of this asset is "true color")
